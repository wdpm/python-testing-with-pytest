Here’s the current Cards testing strategy:
• Test the behaviors and features that are accessible through the end user
interface, the CLI.
• Test those features through the API as much as possible.
• Test the CLI enough to verify the API is getting properly called for all fea-
tures.
• Test the following core features thoroughly: add, count, delete, finish, list, start,
and update.
• Include cursory tests for config and version.
• Test our use of TinyDB with subsystem tests against db.py

Taking the time to write down the features to test, an initial list of test cases,
and a test strategy is up-front time, but it pays for itself quickly as we blast
through implementing the tests, which is the next step
